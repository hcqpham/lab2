			<h1>Claire Huong Pham</h1>
			I'm a 4th year undergraduate student at the University of California, San Diego studying Human-Computer Interaction. In my spare time I like going on road trips and taking photos! I don't really have anything substantial to share in terms of the work that I've done so far, but I hope that change that really soon. (i.e the end of Wi17!)

<i>note: all of my anchors are going to redirect to test.html, because it bothers me that the anchor leads to nowhere. thank you!</i>

		<h3>Here are some pictures I took during Winter Break</h3>
